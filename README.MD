# Getting Started with Python: Data Analysis and Projects

This project, titled **1_Getting_started_ipynb_continuation.ipynb**, is an interactive Jupyter notebook designed to guide users through foundational Python programming concepts and apply them to data analysis and other practical exercises.

## Project Overview

This notebook covers a range of Python features including:

- **Basic Syntax**: Introduction to Python syntax, functions, and control flow (if-else statements, loops).
- **Data Manipulation**: Techniques for handling lists, dictionaries, and common data structures.
- **Debugging Practices**: Implementing debugging techniques to solve common errors in Python code.
- **Games and Simulations**: Examples such as the "Higher Lower Game" and other practical exercises.

## Features

- **Random Number Games**: A number guessing game using `random.randint()` to generate numbers and control difficulty levels (easy/hard).
- **Higher Lower Game**: A simple game using user input to compare choices against a randomly selected option.
- **Mutate Function**: A demonstration of how to manipulate list data, integrate randomness, and debug errors.
- **FizzBuzz**: Implementation of a classic algorithm to test divisibility and logic.
- **Leap Year Checker**: A function to identify leap years, showcasing the use of nested conditionals and modulus operators.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required libraries: `random`, `math`, `art` (ensure that these libraries are installed)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install random art math
    ```
3. Run the notebook in your Jupyter environment.

## Project Files

- **1_Getting_started_ipynb_continuation.ipynb**: The main notebook containing code snippets and exercises.
- **Games and logic-based functions**: Implementations of the number guessing game, Higher Lower Game, FizzBuzz, and more.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions within the notebook for each section. Code is organized with comments to guide you through each part.

## Debugging

Youâ€™ll find several instances where common programming errors (such as incorrect conditional statements) are debugged. These examples will help you practice debugging in Python.
